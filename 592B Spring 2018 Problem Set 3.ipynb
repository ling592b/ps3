    "4. Now take the spectrum of each of the two sampled signals and explain how the spectra show that you recover an aliased signal only for your signal sampled below the Nyquist rate. Note: we have not gone through how to compute spectra in python. Part of the point of this question is to give you guided practice in figuring out how to do things for yourself. You might not understand the math behind what's going on (yet!), but you should be able to figure out the python code you need to use to do this. Hint: you might take a look at the posts [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15382076/plotting-power-spectrum-in-python) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37636017/what-is-the-proper-way-to-plot-spectrum-of-a-complex-signal-sampled-in-a-narrow).\n",
    "5. Use `librosa` to resample the signal at the sampling rates you chose in part 3 of this question and use `Audio` to play the resampled signals. Do they sound different? Do they sound as you expect given your spectra?\n"
